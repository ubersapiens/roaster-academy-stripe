# Roaster Academy

We put together Rails + Stripe to build the first coffee roaster university.

**[git clone the project]**

**[cd roaster-academy-stripe]**

**[bundle exec rake db:drop]**

**[bundle exec rake db:create]**

**[bundle exec rake db:migrate]**

**[bundle exec rake db:seed]**

**[bundle exec rails s]**

**[localhost:3000]**

You will be able to start taking payments from the minute the API keys have been inserted into the "secrets.yml" file.

Clone it, change it, use it, profit.

Gracias
